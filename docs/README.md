Welcome to the GridLAB-D Weather Archive. This archive is organized by country. Please go to the section for your country. If your country is not listed but you have weather data you would like to submit to this archive, please contact the SLAC Gismo team.

As of Version 4.2.1, GridLAB-D can directly manage local copies of this weather data using the [`gridlabd weather`](http://docs.gridlabd.us/index.html?owner=slacgismo&project=gridlabd&branch=develop&folder=/Subcommand&doc=/Subcommand/Weather.md) command.

# United States

The current US weather data is provided in TMY3 format derived from the NREL SAM data sets available at http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/old_data/nsrdb/1991-2005/tmy3/zip/alltmy3a.zip

The files have been renamed from the NREL FN numbered scheme to the GridLAB-D [State]-[Location].tmy3 file naming scheme.

For details on TMY3 data format, see www.nrel.gov/docs/fy08osti/43156.pdf.
